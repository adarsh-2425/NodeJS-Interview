## Coding Question: Implement an Asynchronous Function to Fetch Data from Multiple APIs

You need to create a Node.js function that fetches data from multiple APIs asynchronously and returns the combined result.   
You will receive an array of API URLs as input, and you should make concurrent HTTP requests to all these URLs, retrieve the data   
from each API, and combine it into a single array.
