## Question: Building a User Management System

You are tasked with building a simple User Management System using Node.js. The system should allow users to perform the following actions:

- Create a new user with a unique username and email.
- Retrieve a list of all users.
- Retrieve a specific user by their username.
- Update a user's information (e.g., name, email).
- Delete a user by their username.
### You should follow these guidelines:

- Use asynchronous operations, such as Promises or async/await, for database operations (simulated with an in-memory array).
- Implement proper error handling for various scenarios (e.g., user not found, duplicate username, invalid input, etc.).
- Use appropriate data validation (e.g., validate email format).
- Include comments to explain your code and its logic.
- Follow JavaScript naming conventions and maintain clean code.
- Simulate a database by using an in-memory array to store user data.
