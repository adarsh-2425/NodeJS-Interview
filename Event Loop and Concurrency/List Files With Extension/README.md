## Question:

Write a Node.js program that reads a list of files from a directory and prints the names of all the files in that directory. Additionally, create a function that can filter the list of files by a given file extension (e.g., ".txt" or ".js").

### Requirements:

- Create a Node.js program that uses the fs module to work with the file system.

- Implement a function, listFiles, that takes two parameters: the directory path and an optional file extension filter. If no filter is provided, the function should list all files in the directory. If a filter is provided, it should only list files with that specific extension.

- Use asynchronous file system functions and the event-driven nature of Node.js.

- Print the list of files to the console.
