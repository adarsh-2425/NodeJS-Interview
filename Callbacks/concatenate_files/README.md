## Coding Question: Implement a Function to Read and Concatenate Multiple Files

You need to create a Node.js function that reads multiple text files asynchronously and concatenates their content into a single string.  
Each file should be read sequentially, and the result should be returned in the order in which the files were provided as input.   
Use callbacks to handle the asynchronous file reading.
